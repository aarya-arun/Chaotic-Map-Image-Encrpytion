# Chaotic-Map-Image-Encrpytion

This project includes the code used in our Advanced Algorithms projects which was to encrypt images using chaos maps in python and to compare the usefulness of different maps.

MAPS:
1.Arnold's Cat map
2. Logistic map
3. Henon's map
4. Duffing map
5. A new proposed implemenetation of version of a composite Henon-Arnold map based on a paper "A Chaotic Cryptosystem for images based on Henon and Arnold Cat map" by Solemani et all. https://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2014/536930/

Measuring metrics include intensity histograms, pixel correlation plots and key sensitivity tests.
