# Chaotic-Map-Image-Encrpytion

This project includes the code used our Advanced Algorithms project which was to encrypt images using chaos maps in python and to compare the usefulness of different maps. We also implemented a new chaos map similar to one suggested by the paper mentioned below.

## Built in :

* Python *JuPyter Notebook*

## To deploy :

Download the images and run the notbeook.

## MAPS:

1. Arnold's Cat map
2. Logistic map
3. Henon's map
4. Duffing map
5. A new proposed implementation of version of a composite Henon-Arnold map.

## Composite map:

The composite Henon-Arnold map implemented was based on a paper "A Chaotic Cryptosystem for images based on Henon and Arnold Cat map" by Solemani et all. https://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2014/536930/ 

This map, however, was not exactly the same. 


## Test metrics:

Measuring metrics include intensity histograms, pixel correlation plots and key sensitivity tests.
